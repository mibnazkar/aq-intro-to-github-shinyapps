## Welcome & Setup Check (10 mins)

**Learning Objective:**  Practice key steps for remote code hosting and collaborating in GitHub by using branches, opening pull requests (PRs), reviewing PRs, and merging changes   

:::{.mark}
#### **Activity**: Make your own copy of a repo (`clone`) 
:::

We are going to use the repository <https://github.com/dawnbcgov/aq-intro-to-github-shinyapps> that hosts this website for practice today.

Go ahead and make a copy of the repository with all the files for (or using git terminology "`clone`") this website to your local machine.

```{=html}
<div class="accordion">
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingOne">
      <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseOne">
        <strong>Hint</strong>
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" style="">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <ol>
          <li>Find the URL or address of the repository you want to make a local copy of on GitHub (in this case <code>https://github.com/dawnbcgov/aq-intro-to-github-shinyapps.git</code> (how you clone via GitHub desktop) or <code>git@github.com:dawnbcgov/aq-intro-to-github-shinyapps.git</code> (which is how to clone via cli)) </li>
          <li>If you are using GitHub Desktop, go to File > Clone repository </li>
          <li>Or, if you are using the <code>git</code> cli, use Git Bash and the command <code>git clone <url></code> where the <code><url></code> is the address</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Refresher on key concepts with version control  (10 mins)

- Key concepts we want to review:

#### Version Control 

Sequential changes:

![](https://bcgov.github.io/ds-intro-to-git/materials/images/what-is-vc-1.png)

The power of git and similar version control systems: different versions can be saved, conflicts resolved, and then merged together:

#### Remote Code Hosting and GitHub

#### Branches

## Tracking changes (20 mins)

:::{.mark}
#### **Activity**: Make a change to this site (commit and push)
:::

Now that we each have a copy of this site, we are going to make a change! (First a micro crash course on quarto and markdown)

So, now, on your computer, make a new page for this website in the practice area. Add whatever you want then save it. 
Next, you'll need to commit that change and `push` (or publish / send it) so we all can see.

```{=html}
<div class="accordion">
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingTwo">
      <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">
        <strong>Hint</strong>
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" style="">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <ol>
          <li>Open RStudio, VS Code or your preferred editor, markdown files are like text files so you could use notepad if you want</li>
          <li>Create a new file in the <code>practice</code> folder, it should end in <code>.qmd</code> and needs to have the <code>---</code> section at the top. (You could make a copy of one of the files that are there)</li>
          <li>Make your edits and save</li>
          <li>When you are ready, select the file you changed, commit it (you will need to add a message), and push it</li>          
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Collaboration on GitHub (20 mins)

We've all been working from the `main` branch, but that can be risky for a many reasons.

Just a couple: we might make a mistake while we're working and if we just keep updating the authoritative copy we could miss it. second, two people might change the same file and then we need a process to resolve that conflict.

Git and GitHub give us powerful collaboration tools we can use to manage all these processes! 

:::{.mark}
#### **Activity**: Make a change to another page on a branch and change it back to the main site (pull request)
:::

Finally, lets make an edit to someone elses page on a new `branch` and use the collaboration tools to review and merge those changes (and resolve conflicts!).

```{=html}
<div class="accordion">
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingThree">
      <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">
        <strong>Hint</strong>
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" style="">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <ol>
          <li>First you have to make a new <code>branch</code> give it a name that someone else is not likely to use, like your name</li>
          <li>Open and edit an existing file in the <code>practice</code> folder</li>
          <li>Make your edits and save</li>
          <li>When you are ready, select the file you changed, commit it (you will need to add a message), and push it. There will be an extra step to set up the branch in the repository we are all using depending on your software</li>          
          <li>Then go to GitHub.com and go to the [pull request tab](https://github.com/dawnbcgov/aq-intro-to-github-shinyapps/pulls)</li> Select your branch to "compare" with the main branch and then the button create pull request        
      </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
